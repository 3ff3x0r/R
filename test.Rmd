This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*.

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
# Load the shiny package
library(shiny)

# Define the user interface
ui <- fluidPage(
  # App title
  titlePanel("Dynamic Dashboard Example"),
  
  # Sidebar layout with input and output
  sidebarLayout(
    sidebarPanel(
      # Input: Slider for selecting a number
      sliderInput("num", "Choose a number:",
                  min = 1, max = 100, value = 30)
    ),
    
    # Main panel to display the output
    mainPanel(
      # Output: Display the square of the number
      textOutput("square"),
      plotOutput("plot")

# Define the server logic
server <- function(input, output) {
  # Calculate the square of the number
  output$square <- renderText({
    paste("The square of", input$num, "is", input$num^2)
  })
  
  # Plot a histogram of random normal data based on the input value
  output$plot <- renderPlot({
    hist(rnorm(input$num), main = "Histogram of Random Normal Data",
         xlab = "Values", col = "lightblue", border = "black")
  })
}

# Run the application 
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
